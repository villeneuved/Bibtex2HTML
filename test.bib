	abstract = {Functional group substituents are a ubiquitous tool in ground-state organic chemistry often employed to fine-tune chemical properties and obtain desired chemical reaction outcomes. Their effect on photoexcited electronic states, however, remains poorly understood. To help build an intuition for these effects, we have studied ethylene, substituted with electron acceptor (cyano) and/or electron donor (methoxy) substituents, both theoretically and experimentally: using ab initio quantum molecular dynamics and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Our results show the consistent trend that photo-induced ethylenic dynamics is primarily localized to the carbon with the greater electron density. For doubly substituted ethylenes, the trend is additive when both substituents are located on opposite carbons, whereas the methoxy group (in concert with steric effects) dominates when both substituents are located on a single carbon atom. These results point to the development of rules for structure–dynamics correlations; in this case, a novel mechanistic ultrafast photochemistry for conjugated carbon chains employing long-established chemical concepts.},

	abstract = {Roaming dynamics in real time
Roaming is distinct from conventional reaction channels because of the unusual geometries that chemical systems use to bypass the minimum energy pathway. It is a relatively new phenomenon that is usually determined in experiments through spectroscopic characterization of the roaming products. Using a combination of time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging and quasiclassical trajectory analysis, Endo et al. report real-time observation of individual fragments of the prototypical reaction of deuterated formaldehyde (D2CO) dissociation as they roam on ultrafast time scales. They show that roaming not only occurs several orders of magnitude earlier than previously expected but also that it can terminate in a radical (D + DCO) rather than the well-known molecular (D2 + CO) product channel.
Science, this issue p. 1072
Since the discovery of roaming as an alternative molecular dissociation pathway in formaldehyde (H2CO), it has been indirectly observed in numerous molecules. The phenomenon describes a frustrated dissociation with fragments roaming at relatively large interatomic distances rather than following conventional transition-state dissociation; incipient radicals from the parent molecule self-react to form molecular products. Roaming has been identified spectroscopically through static product channel–resolved measurements, but not in real-time observations of the roaming fragment itself. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI), we directly imaged individual “roamers” on ultrafast time scales in the prototypical formaldehyde dissociation reaction. Using high-level first-principles simulations of all critical experimental steps, distinctive roaming signatures were identified. These were rendered observable by extracting rare stochastic events out of an overwhelming background using the highly sensitive CEI method.
Femtosecond time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging reveals the real-time dynamics of roaming in deuterated formaldehyde (D2CO) dissociation.

	abstract = {Increasing attention has been given to amine–copper formate complexes for their use as low-cost printable conductive inks. The structure of amine ligands coordinated to copper centers has been reported to dictate the properties of copper molecular inks, such as stability and printability, thereby influencing the copper reduction pathway during the thermolysis. Yet, the underlying mechanism by which formate is oxidized when complexed with amine ligands is still not fully understood. Here, we propose a mechanistic pathway of copper formate dehydrogenation and decarboxylation and examine the critical role that amine ligands play in their thermal decomposition by employing first-principles electronic structure computations and experimental analyses of thermolysis reactions. Based on the computational characterization of the relevant reaction pathways for a number of primary and secondary amines as well as pyridine ligand complexes, we are the first to show that the hydrogen bonds formed between the amine ligand and formate are the key factors governing the activation energy, providing a design principle for the synthesis of organic ligands that can tune the height of the reaction barriers of the dehydrogenation and decarboxylation reactions. The calculations, confirmed by NMR studies, show that the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) occurs in concert with the release of H2 via the dimerization of Cu(II) hydride. This result suggests that the monomeric elimination of H2 is not favorable for the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction and thus identifies dimeric amino copper formate as an important intermediate for copper reduction whose thermodynamic stabilities are also dictated by the nature of the amine ligands.},
